# About this Streamlit for Oil Pricing analysis

For now, it will do analysis by using Meta Prophet and ARIMA algorithms.
Eventually thinking about using Random Forest and pinpoint geopolitical events that might impact oil pricing and use it as an input for the Machine Learning model.

# Important point: streamlit page done in Portuguese, but this explanation should serve as short explanation.
